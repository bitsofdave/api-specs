  <p>In order to set a file attribute in another API endpoint (such as a profile file or image field, or adding a file to an event), it is first necessary to upload the file in a separate request. The format for this post request is different from other endpoints of the API. While other endpoints require a json formatted post request, uploading a file should be in a multipart/form-data format. Once you have successfully completed this upload, the response will give you the id of the newly uploaded file, to set for profile attributes or events. As a security feature the download links to files will expire after 10 minutes. Every file download link will include a one-time token. In the case of an image file, the response will show available thumbs, as shown above. </p>

  <p>The response will contain information about the user who owns the access token used to access the API. If the access token belongs to a full Profile, the response content and format will be identical as if you did a show request for that profile. However, if you are accessing via a dedicated API user, the response will be much shorter. The most important element in such a response would be EMAIL. FIRST_NAME and LAST_NAME will both be \&quot;Admin\&quot;. </p>

  <p>The update action is similar to the create action in what is modifiable and how it should be set. You need only pass the attributes that you would like to modify. Any others will remain as they are. </p>
