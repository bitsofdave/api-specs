    summary: Create File
    description: |
      In order to set a file attribute in another API endpoint (such as a profile file or image field, or adding a file to an event), it is first necessary to upload the file in a separate request.

      The format for this post request is different from other endpoints of the API. While other endpoints require a json formatted post request, uploading a file should be in a multipart/form-data format.

      Once you have successfully completed this upload, the response will give you the id of the newly uploaded file, to set for profile attributes or events.

      As a security feature the download links to files will expire after 10 minutes. Every file download link will include a one-time token.

      In the case of an image file, the response will show available thumbs, as shown above.
