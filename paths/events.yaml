/events:
  get:
    summary: Events Index
    description: |
      This method allows a user to retrieve a list of events from their company's home page feed.

      Each event may have one or more linked comments. Each event and comment will have a linked profile, which may have a linked image.

      Announcement events may have an associated file, which will appear in the linked files section. If that file is an image, it will have its available thumbnails

      For more information on how the links/linked system works, please consult the JSON API section of the documentation.

      There are several types of events: "anniversary", "birthday", "announcement", and "new_arrival".

      Anniversary events will have "years_at_company" filled in with the integer value of how many years the profile has been at the company.

      Announcement events will contain "html_content" which is the html formatted content of the event.

      Each event and comment will contain information about whether the user can destroy it, located in "can_destroy".

      This endpoint uses pagination through two optional parameters. The first, limit, defaults to 30 and accepts an integer value. The second, after, should be the id of the first record BEFORE the records that you want to retrieve.

    summary: Create Event
    description: |
      This endpoint will create an "announcement" type event. It is not possible to create other types of events via the API. Instead, they are created automatically when certain event like an employee birthday occurs.

      The content can contain markdown, which will automatically be parsed.

      The file parameters allows you to include file in the crated in the event. As with uploading a file to a profile, the file must be previously uploaded via the file create endpoint.

      Events belong to a profile and therefore cannot be created by a dedicated API user.
